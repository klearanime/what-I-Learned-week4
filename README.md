* I'm finally understanding how the functions and parameters fully work.
* Loops- Need to use -while- instead of -if- statements to keep from printing/entering over. It helps return the index with the for--of- statements and loops through the values to return built in arrays and objects.
* For Loops - else and else if : if the conditions are true, the if. True- If it's accurate or a comparison is a match. If one condition is false you will have to double check the (else if).
* const : Is set to not be changed - use with strings and numbers of given characters
* To get the last character : name.length-1 char or char[] uses string manipulations to the get space location 
* name.indexOf()  
* comments  // use for reference
